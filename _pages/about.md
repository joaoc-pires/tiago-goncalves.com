My name is Tiago Gonçalves and I am an Invited Assistant Professor and PhD in Management at ISEG – Lisbon School of Economics and Management, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal. I have teaching experience at various levels of higher education, especially Bachelor’s and Master’s. 

My research interests are Knowledge Management, Human Resources Management and Organizational Psychology and Behavior. My recent research focuses on the characteristics of Knowledge Management and related phenomena in healthcare organizations, as well as counterproductive forms of knowledge behaviour. 

I am currently a Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology Research Fellow at the ADVANCE/CSG research center, where I study knowledge management in healthcare organizations. 

My research has been published in international journals and presented at both national and international conferences.
